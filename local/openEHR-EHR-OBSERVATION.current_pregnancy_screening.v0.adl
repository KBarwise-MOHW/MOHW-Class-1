Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
- Systematic questioning in any consultation or general health screening situation; or
- Specific questioning related to infectious disease surveillance.

This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry about the pregnancy at a specific point in time. If the individual is pregnant and it is intended that the details are to be recorded and persisted as part of an ongoing health record, any further specific details about the exposure should be recorded using the EVALUATION.pregnancy_summary and related archetypes.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record persistent details about a known pregnancy. Use the EVALUATION.pregnancy_summary archetype for this purpose.">
